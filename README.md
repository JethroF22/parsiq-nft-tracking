## Parsiq NFT Monitoring

This project leverages Parsiq to allow users to monitor NFT transfers linked to wallets and contracts of interest to them. It allows users to create a list of addresses to monitor and displays an event feed that gets updated when a Smart Trigger reacts to an on-chain event that involves one of the addresses that the users is tracking. You can view the [Parsiq documenation here](https://docs.parsiq.net)
